  <h1>Hey there!</h1>
</p>

Iâ€™m **Shatakshi**, an aspiring **Software Engineer** based in India â€” currently exploring the backend universe and diving into computer vision with OpenCV.
I'm building small-scale backend systems from scratch to understand how servers, APIs, databases, and authentication actually work. Alongside, Iâ€™m also experimenting with OpenCV to understand real-world computer vision use cases. Iâ€™m enjoying the process of breaking and making right now.

### I'm working on

- Building REST APIs using **Flask** and **FastAPI**
- Experimenting with **OpenCV** for object detection and image processing
- Writing CLI tools and utilities in Python for automation and learning

### I'm aiming for

- Gaining real-world experience by working on practical backend problems
- Understanding how to design, build, and scale backend systems from scratch
- Collaborating on simple but meaningful open source projects
- Learning how real-world systems handle auth, caching, deployment, and scaling

### Currently Learning

- Python + Flask/FastAPI  
- REST API design patterns  
- OpenCV (image processing & object detection)  
- SQL + MongoDB  
- Git, Linux, and Docker basics  
- How to structure backend projects for maintainability

### Other than Coding

- I like to compose music and write lyrics (and other stuff)
- I sketch
- And enjoy reading and humoring life
